WordMine
========

roguelike game with Typescript and Phaser

Still in a basic setup state. Learning as I go.

The idea is a roguelike where you mine out connected rooms to find letters and other stuff.
You use the letters to fight the creeps in a bookworm-like word-making battle.

The images are placeholder so far.
